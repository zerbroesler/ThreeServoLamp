# ThreeServoLamp

This is a hardware / software project to build (another) LED lamp.
The idea is to have multiple spheres which can glow in any color by using WS2812B LED strips. This prototype has three of them therefore the name 'ThreeServoLamp'.
To make it more interesting, the lamp can move the spheres up and down to not only change the color, but also the shape of the lamp.

## Hardware
servo motors 'hacked' to operate in endless mode to make it possible to have reasonable distances the spheres can move.
8cm sheres with LED strips within.


## Software
The servos and the leds are controlled by an arduino. There is currently no possibility to control the behaviour.
An idea is to have
* physical sensor panels...
* bluetooth control.
